# Gps
reads gps data and live plots the position over a sattelite image, inputs needed are the x and y extent of the photo
in latitude and longitude
to get library used in sparkfun code use pip install sparkfun-ublox-gps
to use the plot functions will need a photo from google earth as well as the starting and beginninh latitude and longitude coordinates
this repositor is not especiallyt helpful or useful after I learned how to get the rtk gps to work well, check the ntrip client tools repository for more updated work
